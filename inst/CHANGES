		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.8-1 (2006-02-23)

    o    `testtype' can be Bonferroni, MonteCarlo, Univariate and
         Teststatistic (instead of Raw)		

    o    removed unnecessary constraint on weights in `cforest'

    o    maximize raw test statistics for random forest by default.


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.8-0 (2006-02-15)		


    o    `cforest', an implementation of Breiman's random forest ensemble
         algorithm based on conditional inference trees (`ctree') has been
	 added. It is somewhat experimental and thus for advanced users only.

    o    `mob', an object-oriented implementation of a recently suggested
         algorithm for model-based recursive partitioning (Zeileis, Hothorn,
	 Hornik, 2005) has been added. It works out of the box for partitioning
	 (generalized) linear regression models, others can be easily plugged
	 in. A new vignette "MOB" describes the implementation ideas and provides
	 a few examples.

    o    new S3 generic reweight() with methods for (g)linearModel
         for re-fitting a model with different weights.

    o    new argument `maxdepth' to `ctree_control' which allows for
         growing trees of a fixed maximum depth.

    o    LazyData: yes
    

		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-6 (2006-02-06)


    o    use a different way to deal with NAMESPACEs during in tests/*.R
         following a suggestion by Prof. Brian D. Ripley

    o    use LazyLoad: yes instead of SaveImage: yes

		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-1 (2005-12-02)


    o    fix bug introduced in version 0.3-0: coin:::factor_trafo applies
         treatment contrasts in case of a binary factor but we need the full
         design matrix

    o    documentation updates


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-0 (2005-11-29)


    o    `ytrafo' and `xtrafo' functions make use of `coin:::trafo' now,
         i.e. the handling of influence functions and transformations
         has been unified in packages `party' and `coin'


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-10 (2005-11-08)


    o    new slot `data' in BinaryTree objects, slots inputnames and levels 
         have been removed


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-9 (2005-10-19)


    o    splits in categorical variables could have failed due 
         to weired internal checks

    o    fix problems reported by codetools

    o    ctree() now searches the global environment for variables given
         in `formula' when the `data' argument is unspecified.



		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-4 (2005-07-07)


    o    names of `criterion' element in `SplittingNode' objects were wrong

    o    categorical splits with `ctree_control(testtype = "MonteCarlo")'
         were potentially wrong



		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-3 (2005-06-29)


    o   print and plot only levels which are available in a node (for nominal
        splits)



		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-2 (2005-06-27)
